    "`B` and `B_bruteforce` yield the identical results. However, `B` only requires two graph traversals to calculate the marginals, whereas `B_bruteforce` requires listing and calculating the marginals for every combination. This makes it so that the brute force approach takes nearly ten times as long as the sum-product algorithm in our example."
